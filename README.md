# interest_rate_analysis

<h1>Overview: </h1>
This is a project to investigate how certain metrics may or may not influence the fed rate changing.

<h3>Scope</h3>
We will build a model to predict whether the chosen metrics potentially influence the change in the fed rate.
We will utilize D3 to allow user interaction on our charts.
The user will be able to choose from a list of metrics which will change the visualization in real time.

<h3>Key metrics we will investigate:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Inflation Measurements</li>
    <li>Repurchase Agreements</li>
    <li>Foreign Exchange Rates</li>
    <li>Central Bank Liquidity</li>
    <li>Currency in Circulation</li>
    <li>Reserve Balances</li>
    <li>Total Capital and Liabilities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Source</h3>
Data will be extracted from quandl<br>

<h3>Deploy</h3>
